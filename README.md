An interactive PowerBI Dashboard based on the Spotifya Kaggle dataset categorizing numerous artists in a filterable format, capable of comparing 9+ KPIs. Utilized external tools like Spotify Developer API, Deneb, Bravo, and more to achieve the result while also introducing calculated measures and a fair bit of DAX coding.
Key focus: Streamlined shortlisting and visualization and User Interactability
